1. Nature of Service
  
  LegalAI provides summaries of legal documents and general information about legal rights using AI technologies. This information is for  informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. Use of this Service does not create an attorney-client relationship. For personalized legal advice, please consult a qualified attorney licensed in your jurisdiction.
  
2. No Guarantee of Legal Accuracy
